# Solar-Tracking-Project

This project will develop an easy-to-use API for controlling a directional solar panel system using the PIC24 microcontroller. The system will use light sensors to detect the brightest light source and adjust the solar panelâ€™s position for optimal sunlight exposure. A DC motor will move the panel based on real-time sensor readings, ensuring maximum energy absorption. This will first be done with only one axis of movement, and a second axis of movement will be implemented if enough time is available.
